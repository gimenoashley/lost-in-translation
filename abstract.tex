Internet slang is an informal variation of language that is prominent to the younger generation.
The usage of this language brought generational divide between them and the older generations.
This study aimed to develop a translation tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge this issue.
A dataset of Generation Z slang sentences and their formal equivalents was used to fine-tune an existing LLM.
The model was trained to translate slang sentences into formal English, and was compared against the baseline model using various evaluation metrics.
