Internet slang is an informal variation of language that is prominent to the younger generation.
The usage of this language brought generational divide between them and the older generations.
This study aims to develop a translation tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge this issue.
A dataset of Generation Alpha slang sentences and their formal equivalents will be used to fine-tune an existing LLM.
The model will be trained to translate slang sentences into formal English, and will be compared against the baseline model using various evaluation metrics.
The study highlights the significance of addressing communication gaps and provides insights into how technology can enhance understanding and reduce miscommunications across generations.
This research contributes to the broader discourse on language adaptation and generational communication in the digital age.
