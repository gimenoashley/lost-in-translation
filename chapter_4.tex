\chapter{Preliminary Results/System Prototype}
A prototype LoRA implementation was created on Google Colab. 
This uses zephyr-7b-beta model as the base model for finetuning and a part of the ultrachat dataset as the training dataset.
The zephyr-7b-beta model was chosen as it is one of the best performing model after LoRA finetuning \cite{zhao2024loraland310finetuned}.
This chapter  presents the preliminary results or the system prototype of your SP.  Include screenhots, tables, or graphs and provide the discussion of results.
