\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Limitations}
Language is dynamic and constantly evolving, making it difficult to establish clear boundaries on when slang terms emerge or fade within a generation. Additionally, the dataset created for this study was relatively small, and the number of evaluators involved was limited. In addition, as stated in Section 3.1.3, the computational constraints posed a challengeâ€”loading a model with 7 billion parameters requires approximately 66 GB of memory, while Google Colab provided 16GB of VRAM which is insufficient for high-capacity models.

\section{Recommendations}
Future researchers are encouraged to expand the vocabulary of slang terms on the Internet and explore more recent trends, taking into account the dynamic nature of language. It is also recommended that future studies utilize a larger and more diverse dataset to improve the robustness of the findings.
